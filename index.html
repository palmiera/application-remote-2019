        <h2>Two heads are better than one</h2>
        <h3>Pair programming is a technique in wich two programmers work together side by side at one workstation. 
          <br>
          <br>One is writing the code on the computer and the other one is looking and reviewing each line of code. The one who's writing the code is called the Driver and the one that's reviewing each line of code that the Driver types in is called the Navigator.</h3>

        <h3>The Navigator thinks about the big picture, strategy and what comes next while scanning for typographical error or bugs. That gives the Driver time to focus all the attention on the actual task. 
          <br>
          <br>The Pair programmers switch roles frequently about every five minutes or so.</h3> 
        <h2>"A problem shared, is a problem halved"</h2>
        <h3>It's easier to catch mistakes when two people focus on the same code base. It takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesnâ€™t require later effort in troubleshooting, debugging and exposing users to a broken product. When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster. As a team, the chances are that one of you has come across a similar mistake before. Also, pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.</h3>
